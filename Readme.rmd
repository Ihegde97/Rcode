# Readme 

The goal of this repository is to give the interested user a sample of
some recent code written by me in R. All code will contain an 
associated R script -- either in .R or .Rmd format -- and a pdf 
report explaining the code. 

The structure is as follows:

* In-class: contains R code for the in-class exercises in 
my microeconometrics class at CEMFI.

* Homework: contains some code that I wrote for the homework 
assigments of the microeconometrics course at CEMFI.
